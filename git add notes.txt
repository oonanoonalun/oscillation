Committing changes to github is 3 steps: Stage changes, Commit Them, Push commits

1 Stage changes (choose what changes to commit)


Use `git add` to add changes

git add $filename # Add all changes to $filename

git add -p # go through every change one at a time and prompt whether to stage, skip, etc

git add -i # interactive interface for updating what is staged
# use option `4 add untracked` to add new files to the repo
# use option `2 update` to add changes
# use option `3 revert` to unstage a change

1.1 review changes:
git diff --staged # Will show all changes staged for the current commit, review that they are the change to you want to commit.


2 Commit changes:
git commit -m "This is a message for this commit, e.g., I fixed the broken thing."

3 Push changes to github:
git push # Once this succeeds other people can view the commits.
